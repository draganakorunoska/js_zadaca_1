/**
 1. JavaScript arrays can contain a mix of different data types. 
 2. JavaScript arrays are indexed arrays and so, 
 array elements cannot be accessed using arbitrary strings as indexes, as in associative arrays.
 3. JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, 
 the second is at index 1, and so on â€” and the last element is at the value of the array's length property 
 minus 1.
 4. JavaScript arrays can be created using the array constructor and array literal syntax []. 
 (*** or from an array-like object, such as a NodeList or arguments object ***).
